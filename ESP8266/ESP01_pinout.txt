RST   -> 10k -> Vcc // pullup
      -> SW  -> Vcc 

EN    -> 10k -> Vcc

GPIO0 -> 10k -> Vcc // pullup
      -> SW  -> GND

GPIO1 => TX0 // built-in LED
GPIO2 => TX1
GPIO3 => RX0

GPIO0 - flash mode, boot fails if LOW
GPIO1 - HIGH at boot, boot fails if LOW
GPIO2 - HIGH at boot, LED, boot fails if LOW
GPIO3 - HIGH at boot

GPIO0:  flash mode if pulled LOW
GPIO1:  pin is high at BOOT, boot failure if pulled LOW
GPIO2:  pin is high on BOOT, boot failure if pulled LOW
GPIO3:  pin is high at BOOT
GPIO9:  pin is high at BOOT
GPIO10: pin is high at BOOT
GPIO15: boot failure if pulled HIGH
GPIO16: pin is high at BOOT
